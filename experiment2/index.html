			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animations, and Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<p>The code that I mainly started with for this experiment include p5.js code generated from Wesbot, an example about how to generate
					smoke particles from the p5.js website, and code that I found by Katie Liu who created a sketch that generated multiple flowers.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<p>For the gradient effect, I altered the code so that I would get the right color scale that I desired and made sure that the effect
					went from dark to light rather than light to dark. For the particle effect, instead of using the example as a base, I merely used it as inspiration
					for my own system that's a lot simpler, yet was able to achieve the effect that I wanted. For the flowers, I used the code that I found from Katie Liu by 
					changing the amount of flowers generated, along with the shape and visual appearance.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<p>After getting familiar with the technqiues I learned, I used that knowledge to enhance some of the pieces that I had already, for example, 
					the ground and the flowers. I applied the gradient effect to the ground to give it more character and included the mouseclicked() function
					to make it so the user can make the flowers appear and change their colors each time they clicked on the canvas.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I worked on this project on my own and while my project may appear simple, there was a lot of time and effort that took place
					in making sure that everything worked the way I wanted it to. My highs included being able to pull off all the special features 
					I worked on, such as the gradient effect, the particle effect, and the flowers. My lows included having to figure out how to make 
					sure that my code translated well in both the p5.js editor and on my own static webpage, as this was surprisingly difficult to do.
