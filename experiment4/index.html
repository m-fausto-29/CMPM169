			<h1>Experiment 4 - Images, Video, & Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I mainly took inspiration from a piece by Ivan Rudnicki where they created an interactive Vinyl Turntable that produced sound when the user sets down the Vinyl
					and decided to create a modern take on this piece.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>Along with utilizing code that I have integrated in past experiments, I also found resources online where I combined their code to produce
					effects that I wanted to achieve. I also used an example from a YouTube video and p5.js as a base to build off of.</p>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>For this section, I improved my main audio visualizer by making it radial instead, while also improving a particle system I had used before in a previous experiment
					to give this piece more visual appeal.
				</p>
				
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this experiment by myself with the help of a couple online resources. I learned a lot about image and sound manipulation through this piece and will definitely 
					refer back to this piece in the future. I had fun working on a piece with a bright aesthetic, along with incorporating one of my favorite songs as well. There were a couple of
					minor hiccups that I was thankfully able to resolve, but overall I am happy with the final product.
