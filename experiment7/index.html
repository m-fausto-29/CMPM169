			<h1>Experiment 7 - Data Visualizations and Networks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this experiment I took inspiration from Sydney Park's method of grabbing data through a CSV file and representing it visually and also wanted to take a similar
					approach that I have seen in CodingTrain's videos where he used 3D objects to represent data.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After getting familiar with Sydney Park's tutorial, I went ahead and adapted my own version of representing data through the use of 3D shapes in the p5.js library.
					So in my experiment, I used a CSV file that contained the top rated MetaCrtic games and used spheres to represent the data. The size of the sphere is determined by the
					score received from the data and the color of the sphere is determined by if the score was given by a critic or a user.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Once I got the base somewhat finished, I expanded upon that further by including custom graphics that displayed the numerical score of each game given by a critic or user.
					I also implemented some rotations for the spheres to make the visual representation more interesting.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section"> 
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this experiment primarily by myself with the help of some online resources, but I will admit that it was a bit of a challenge coming up with a solid idea on how to 
					visually represent data, whether that be through CSV file or API. Which then led to my decision to start off simple and then expand from there. That way it leaves room for improvement
					without worrying about the complexity of the project.
