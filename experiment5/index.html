			<h1>Experiment 5 - 3D Graphics</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I decided to replicate the goal ring that appears at the end of a level in the video game series Sonic the Hedgehog.
					The idea came to me as I was browsing through 3D art pieces in OpenProcessing and I came across an example that showcased a 3D ring.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p> After looking through various examples online from sources such as the lecture slides, YouTube, the p5.js library, Open Processing and by simply searching through Google
					I was able to find a few examples that I could use as a starting point. I then integrated the code into my own project and began to modify it to fit my needs.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>One of the topics that caught my attention from the previous experiment was the use of a webcam, so I thought of integrating that into one of my existing revolving objects
					as a texture. I also thought of adding a particle system that I previously used to the ring to make it look more interesting. Finally, to make the ring closely resemble the reference
					photo even further, I made use of what I learned about 3D shapes to create the result I wanted to finish off the piece.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>With the help of a few resources from online, I worked on this piece mainly by myself and learned a lot through this process. For the most part, it was a matter of trial and error
					when figuring out how to integrate the pieces of code the way I wanted to. The main high I would say about working on this piece would mainly be the freedom to recreate a piece of 
					nostalgia from my childhood. While the piece may not be reflected well in my static webpage in comparison to what I have in my p5.js editor, the time and effort is still the same.
