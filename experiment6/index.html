			<h1>Experiment 6 - Grammars and Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I was drawn by the 3D Typography example shown in lecture and attempted to recreate the ending title screen effect that is commonly shown in the Kingdom Hearts video game series.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I first played around with the 3D Typography example in the OpenProcessing online editor and tried to familiarize myself with how the code work before moving it to the p5.js online editor.
					After that, I started to experiment with the code by finding a way to incorporate lighting and a neon effect to the main text that appears after you zoom out.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>After adding some special effects to the reversing text and lighting, I was not able to get the neon effect to work so I improvised by making my own interpretation of a
					neon effect by adding a couple layers of the main text and flickering them on and off by using fill that's randomly generated.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was probably my most experimental project so far as a lot of the things I attempted were not working out the way I wanted to. There was a lot more improvisation this time around but I still learned a lot 
					from this process. For example, I learned that 2D shapes and 3D shapes are very particular if you choose to work with them within the same space.
				</p>
