			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Methods</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I wanted to try replicating Andrea Diotallevi's Moon piece and where she utilized
					the noise function to create a moon-like shape. What I wanted to do was recreate the Salinas Valley
					and create mountains with that same function.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I started this experiment by first playing around with Diotallevi's code and understanding what each line did. After
					attempting to create mountains in this style, I saw that it was not working out. I then decided to scrap the idea but still 
					keep the noise concept in mind and reworked my mountain generation code. Afterwards, I decided to implememt a sky and ground by
					reimplementing code I used in a previous experiment and modified it to fit the current experiment.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>During section, there was a discussion about integrating buttons for our projects so I decided to include a button where each time
					the user clicks it, the background changes to mimic the time of day. I also decided to include cloud animations that move across
					the canvas to make the experiment more immersive and looked toward mbardin's animation code for inspiration.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I worked on alone with the help of a couple online resources and learned a lot about the capabilities of the noise
					function. Despite the slight difficulty I had with implementing the mountains in the beginning, I was able to still create a piece that 
					I was happy with.
